# Plugin architecture

A **plugin** is a directory that bundles BotNexus components - skills, agents, commands, hooks
and MCP server definitions - so they can be distributed and installed as one unit instead of
being copied file by file.

This document describes the **on-disk contract** only. Installation, update/remove lifecycle,
transport (git or otherwise), trust decisions, and wiring into skill discovery, agent config
sources, MCP or cron are deliberately out of scope here and are covered by later slices of
the plugin epic (#2623).

## Directory layout

```
my-plugin/
  .botnexus-plugin/
    plugin.json        # the manifest - the only required file
  skills/              # discovered by convention
  agents/
  commands/
  hooks/
  .mcp.json
```

The manifest lives at `.botnexus-plugin/plugin.json`. A directory without that file is not a
plugin and is rejected rather than treated as an empty one.

## The manifest

The manifest adopts the Claude Code field set so plugins authored for that ecosystem port with
no translation layer. Only `name` is required:

```json
{ "name": "hello-world" }
```

That single-field manifest is valid and complete. Components are **discovered by convention**
at the plugin root, so a well-laid-out plugin never needs to enumerate its own paths. The
explicit path fields (`skills`, `agents`, `commands`, `hooks`, `mcpServers`) exist only as an
override for plugins with a non-conventional layout.

This distinction is load-bearing in the parsed model: an omitted component field deserialises
to `null`, meaning *discover by convention*. It is never normalised to an empty collection,
which would instead mean *this plugin deliberately has none*.

## Marketplaces

A marketplace catalog lists plugins available from a publisher. It requires `name`, `owner`
and `plugins[]`; each entry requires a `name` and a `source`.

```json
{
  "name": "core-marketplace",
  "owner": { "name": "BotNexus Team" },
  "plugins": [
    { "name": "hello-world", "source": "https://example.com/hello.git" }
  ]
}
```

## Schema is the single source of truth

Two JSON Schema files define the contract:

- `src/extensions/BotNexus.Extensions.Plugins/Schemas/plugin-manifest.schema.json`
- `src/extensions/BotNexus.Extensions.Plugins/Schemas/marketplace.schema.json`

`PluginManifestParser` **loads** these schemas (embedded from the same checked-in files) and
validates against them. It contains no hand-written list of field names or required fields.
This mirrors how `skills/botnexus-maintenance/reference/issue-schema.json` is the single
source of truth for the issue linter, and it exists because every consumer that re-derives a
shape eventually drifts from it - which is precisely what happened to the label taxonomy and
the issue schema before they were centralised.

Tests assert that the parser's reported required-field set equals the `required` array read
directly out of the schema text, so the two cannot silently diverge. Adding a required field
to the schema is therefore sufficient - and necessary - to make the parser enforce it.

## Rejection, not coercion

A manifest that does not match the schema is **rejected**, and the resulting error names the
offending field. There is no best-effort coercion:

- a missing `name` is an error, not a defaulted empty string;
- `"name": 7` is an error, not the string `"7"`;
- an unknown field such as `"skilz"` is an error, not silently ignored.

Silently ignoring a misspelled field is the worst outcome available: the author believes their
plugin declares something it does not, and nothing ever tells them otherwise. Guessing at an
unknown shape means installing something the author did not write.

`ParseManifest` returns a `PluginParseResult<T>` carrying either the typed value or every
validation error found, rather than throwing on the first problem, so a scan across many
plugin directories can report all bad manifests in one pass.
