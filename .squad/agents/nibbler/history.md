# Project Context

- **Owner:** Jon Bullen
- **Project:** BotNexus — modular AI agent execution platform (OpenClaw-like) built in C#/.NET. Lean core with extension points for assembly-based plugins. Multiple agent execution modes (local, sandbox, container, remote). Currently focusing on local execution. SOLID patterns with vigilance against over-abstraction. Comprehensive testing (unit + E2E integration).
- **Stack:** C# (.NET latest), modular class libraries: Core, Agent, Api, Channels (Base/Discord/Slack/Telegram), Command, Cron, Gateway, Heartbeat, Providers (Base/Anthropic/OpenAI/Copilot), Session, Tools.GitHub, WebUI
- **Created:** 2026-04-01

## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

- 2026-04-01: Added to team as Consistency Reviewer after Jon caught docs/architecture.md not reflecting the ~/.botnexus/ unified config that was implemented after the docs were written. Multi-agent workflows have a systemic consistency gap — each agent updates their own files but nobody checks the seams.

## 2026-04-02 — Team Updates

- **Nibbler Onboarding:** New team member added. Role: Consistency Reviewer. Owns post-sprint consistency audits (docs vs code, docs vs docs, code comments vs behavior, README vs current state).
- **New Ceremony:** Consistency Review ceremony established. Trigger: after sprint completion or architectural changes. Owner: Nibbler. First implementation: Leela's audit (2026-04-02) found 22 issues across 5 files.
- **Related Decision:** "Cross-Document Consistency Checks as a Team Ceremony" merged into decisions.md (2026-04-01T18:54Z directive from Jon).


### 2026-04-02 — Sprint 5 Complete: Agent Workspace, Memory, Deployment Lifecycle

**Overview:** Sprint 5 delivered the core agent infrastructure (workspace + identity), memory management system (long-term + daily with consolidation), and comprehensive deployment lifecycle validation (10 real-process E2E scenarios).

**Achievement:** 48/50 items done. 2 P2 items deferred (Anthropic tool-calling, plugin architecture deep-dive). Team grew from 6 to 8 agents (Nibbler + Zapp added).

**Workspace & Identity (Leela ws-01/02, Farnsworth ws-03/04/05):**
- Agent workspace structure: ~/.botnexus/agents/{agent-name}/ with SOUL/IDENTITY/USER/AGENTS/TOOLS/MEMORY files
- BotNexusHome.Initialize() creates workspace structure and stub files
- Multi-agent awareness via auto-generated AGENTS.md (from config + identity files)
- File-based persistent identity and personality system
- Integration tests for workspace creation, file structure, and initialization

**Context Builder & Memory Services (Bender ws-06 through ws-12, Farnsworth ws-13):**
- IContextBuilder interface replaces flat systemPrompt with file-driven context assembly
- Context loads workspace files (SOUL, IDENTITY, USER, AGENTS, TOOLS, MEMORY) at session start
- Memory tools added: memory_search (FTS), memory_save, memory_get, memory_list
- Daily memory files (~/.botnexus/agents/{name}/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) auto-loaded for today + yesterday
- Long-term MEMORY.md consolidation via LLM-based distillation
- Token budget trimming integrated into context builder

**Heartbeat & Memory Consolidation (Bender ws-15, Farnsworth ws-16):**
- IHeartbeatService runs daily consolidation job: distills daily files → MEMORY.md
- Controlled pruning prevents unbounded memory growth
- Health check integrated with heartbeat service

**Deployment Lifecycle Testing (Hermes ws-17 through ws-21):**
- Implemented 10 real-process E2E scenarios in tests/BotNexus.Tests.Deployment/
- GatewayProcessFixture: spawns Gateway via dotnet run with isolated temp dirs, health probes
- Scenarios cover: install, config creation, startup, agent workspace setup, message routing, multi-agent handoff, session persistence, graceful shutdown, restart with session restoration, platform update, health management, OAuth integration
- All 10 pass. Scenario registry now 86% coverage (48/56 total scenarios).
- Key discovery: Sessions persisted across restart; workspace creation is lazy (on first message); extension loading is explicit, not auto-scanning.

**Scenario Registry & Team Expansion (Leela ws-22, Zapp scenario-registry + deployment-lifecycle-tests):**
- Zapp added to team: owns E2E deployment validation, deployment lifecycle tests
- Nibbler added to team: owns consistency reviews, post-sprint audits
- Scenario registry process formalized: Hermes maintains as living document after sprint completion
- Consistency review ceremony established: triggered after sprint or architecture changes

**Process Updates:**
- All decisions from inbox merged into decisions.md (decisions #9, #10, #11)
- Inbox files deleted (merged, not orphaned)
- Cross-agent consistency checks now a formal ceremony with Nibbler as owner
- Documentation updated and consistency audit completed (Leela: 22 issues fixed across 5 files)

**Outstanding:**
- 2 P2 items deferred to next sprint: Anthropic tool-calling feature parity, plugin architecture deep-dive
- Hearbeat service still needs HealthCheck.AggregateAsync() implementation (minor gap)
- Plugin discovery (AssemblyLoadContext per extension) not yet fully tested with real extension deployments

## Session Completion: 2026-04-02

**Sprints Completed:** 1-6  
**Items Done:** 71 of 73 (97.3%)  
**Tests Passing:** 395  
**Scenario Coverage:** 64/64 (100%)  
**Team Size:** 12 agents  

**Major Achievements:**
- Dynamic extension loading fully operational
- Copilot OAuth integration complete and tested
- Multi-agent routing with assistant classification deployed
- Agent workspaces with durable file storage working
- Centralized memory system with consolidation running
- Centralized cron service architecture finalized (pending implementation)
- Authentication/authorization layer deployed across Gateway, WebSocket, REST
- Security hardening: ~/.botnexus/ live environment fully protected
- Observability framework (metrics, tracing, health checks) integrated
- WebUI deployed with real-time status feeds
- Full E2E scenario coverage: 64/64 scenarios passing

**Deferred (P2):** 2 Anthropic items awaiting clarification

**Decisions Merged:**
1. Cron service as independent first-class scheduler
2. Live environment protection (~/.botnexus/ isolation)

**Next Steps:** Production deployment readiness, Sprint 7 planning for P2 items.
