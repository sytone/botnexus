# Project Context

- **Owner:** Jon Bullen
- **Project:** BotNexus — modular AI agent execution platform (OpenClaw-like) built in C#/.NET. Lean core with extension points for assembly-based plugins. Multiple agent execution modes (local, sandbox, container, remote). Currently focusing on local execution. SOLID patterns with vigilance against over-abstraction. Comprehensive testing (unit + E2E integration).
- **Stack:** C# (.NET latest), modular class libraries: Core, Agent, Api, Channels (Base/Discord/Slack/Telegram), Command, Cron, Gateway, Heartbeat, Providers (Base/Anthropic/OpenAI), Session, Tools.GitHub, WebUI
- **Created:** 2026-04-01

## Learnings

### 2026-04-01 — Architecture Review: Anthropic Provider Gaps (from Leela)

**Critical findings affecting your work:**
- **Tool Calling Missing:** OpenAI provider supports tool calling. Anthropic provider does not. Needs implementation for feature parity (P1).
- **No DI Extension:** Anthropic provider exists but has no `AddAnthropicProvider()` method in ServiceCollectionExtensions. OpenAI has one; Anthropic needs one too (P0 blocker).
- **CA2024 Warning:** AnthropicProvider streaming has `EndOfStream` check instead of `ReadLineAsync` check. Minor fix for compiler warning (P1).
- **Provider Parity:** Once tool calling is added to Anthropic, it should be tested against the same integration tests as OpenAI to ensure feature parity.

Build is clean, tests pass. ProviderRegistry exists but is unused — evaluate integration or removal.
