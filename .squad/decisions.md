## Active Decisions

### 1. Initial Architecture Review Findings (2026-04-01)

**Author:** Leela (Lead/Architect)  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Requested by:** Jon Bullen

**Context:** First-pass architecture review of BotNexus — the initial port and setup. No PRD, no spec, no docs. System has never been built, deployed, or run. This review establishes the baseline.

**Key Findings:**

**The Good:**
- Clean contract layer: Core defines 13 well-designed interfaces. Dependencies flow inward. No circular references.
- Build is green: Solution compiles on .NET 10.0 with 0 errors, 2 minor warnings. All 124 tests pass.
- SOLID compliance: Interfaces are small and focused. Single implementations justified by extension model.
- Hierarchical config: BotNexusConfig well-structured with per-agent overrides and sensible defaults.
- Test foundation: 121 unit tests + 3 integration tests. xUnit + FluentAssertions + Moq.
- Agent loop: Well-structured agentic loop with tool calling, session persistence, hooks, MCP support.

**The Concerning:**
- Channel registration gap: Discord, Slack, Telegram are implemented but never registered in Gateway DI.
- Anthropic provider incomplete: OpenAI supports tool calling; Anthropic does not. No DI extension method.
- No auth anywhere: No authentication/authorization on Gateway REST, WebSocket, or API endpoints.
- Sync-over-async hazard: `MessageBusExtensions.Publish()` wraps async with `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` — deadlock timebomb.
- ProviderRegistry unused: Class exists but never registered in DI or referenced. Dead code.
- Slack webhook gap: Slack channel uses webhook mode but Gateway has no incoming webhook endpoint.
- No plugin/assembly loading: README mentions extensibility, but no mechanism exists.
- Gateway dispatches to first runner only: `runners[0].RunAsync()` — only first IAgentRunner is used.

**P0 — Must Fix Before First Run:**
1. Register channel implementations in Gateway DI (conditional on config Enabled flags)
2. Add Anthropic DI extension (matching OpenAI pattern)
3. Remove sync-over-async wrapper (delete or rewrite MessageBusExtensions.Publish())
4. Add basic configuration documentation (appsettings.json structure)

**P1 — Should Fix Soon:**
5. Add authentication (at minimum, API key auth on REST/WebSocket)
6. Implement Anthropic tool calling (feature parity with OpenAI)
7. Fix first-runner-only dispatch (route by agent name or document intentional single-runner design)
8. Add Slack webhook endpoint (Gateway needs POST for Slack events)
9. Fix CA2024 warning in AnthropicProvider streaming

**P2 — Should Plan:**
10. Design plugin architecture (assembly loading, plugin discovery, dynamic registration)
11. Add observability (metrics, tracing, health check endpoints)
12. Documentation (architecture, setup guide, API reference)
13. Evaluate ProviderRegistry (integrate or remove dead code)

**Decision Needed:** Team consensus on priority order before implementation begins.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
